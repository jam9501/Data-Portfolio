        <h1>Map of Gas Leak Distribution in New York City</h1>
        <div class="projects">
            <p>I created this map displaying gas leaks in New York City using QGIS, a geographic information system software. The interactive web version below has a tooltip implemented, where the user can hover over a neighborhood and the labels appear. I analyzed U.S. data, and found New York City has the highest rates of gas leaks in the country. Then, I analyzed the Fire Department of New York City's data, and found the Bronx had some of the highest rates of gas leaks within the city. Additionally, Morrisania had more gas leaks than 68% of all New York City neighborhoods. This could be a larger taxpayer story, with new scholarly research suggesting New Yorkers could be paying more than $77 million annually in gas leak repairs.</p>

            <p>This is a prototype game interactive that mimics the experience of people with motor disabilities using a mouse, with a research analysis. The left side is a "control" of sorts, assuming the user does not have a motor disability. I coded the right side to illustrate how difficult it is for someone with a motor disability to complete a dragging movement using a traditional mouse. I used Python, a coding software, for the data analysis and D3 + JavaScript for the game:

            <p>I scraped and extracted the data from the New York State Senate website (https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation) for all bills passed in 2023, using Selenium—a coding library. Then, I used an OpenAI library, ChatGBT, with Python to code a function for categorizing bills by topic. The spreadsheet and coding notebook are available:

With JavaScript, I created a scrolly-telling template, which allows the reader to scroll through the story. I used Python for the analysis. I interviewed the only software developer at Amazon experiencing blindness on his experience with inaccessible tools:

                <h2> My journalistic philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    My philosophy for reporting is simple: apply the artistry of storytelling to complex fiscal and political ideas. For a journalistic body to reach homeostasis, reporters must find a way to demystify important issues without patronizing readers or viewers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Democratizing data— putting information directly in consumer’s hands— is a vital step to restoring balance in the press, and combating the spread of misinformation.
                </p>
                <p>And, fostering data and visualization initiatives in newsrooms lead to more engagement and efficient reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    Graphics, photos, and visualizations stimulate active learning and help readers digest material, according to Jeffrey L. Griffin and 
                    Robert L. Stevenson’s <span class="highlight yellow">
                        <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15551399609363328" target="_blank">research</a>
</span>.
                </p>
<p>“The ability to answer and accuracy were highest for the group with the story plus infographic plus photo,” reported the journal, adding the group with the lowest accuracy received the text without graphics or photos.
</p>
<p>Visualizations provide readers and viewers more ways to interpret content—improving accessibility, thus engagement.
    AI and programming tools, like scraping websites and building automated datasets, help reporters complete stories faster and cover more investigative content.
    </p>
                <p>
                    We need to build trust in communities through multi-layered representation— diverse reporters and sources— and digestible data.
                </p>

                    Scholars, academics and journalists alike know the problems plaguing the industry—and democracy— but it’s time to develop straightforward solutions. <strong>Let’s talk about it.</strong>

                <h2> My story </h2> 
                <p>
                    Growing up, I imagined my first cries not as a defining moment of birth—but one where I pleaded for my whole body back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a young girl who had a stroke in the womb, my limited abilities often dictated my interests. I had adolescent dreams of becoming a surgeon or firefighter, but I always found a needle prodding my back of doubt and incurable incompetence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, at five-years-old, I sat at a desk, in a tiny plastic chair I couldn’t fit into now, and wrote, “The dog chased the cat.” It wasn’t the sentence heard around the world, but in my own microcosm, the orbit shifted to a whole new trajectory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a child, my instinctual malleability of syntax supplemented the natural physical abilities I lacked. My first story, “We Never Had a Library,” introduced a group of children who wanted to read, but never learned how—and followed their journey of building a library for their town. I felt the act of writing grow out of my body like another limb: an extension of myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ran to my elementary school’s librarian to ask if she could publish it. She likely thought the request was cute and decided to humor me, but I’m grateful she did. When I put the laminated label on my book, and placed it on the correct shelf using the Dewey Decimal System, I dropped the notion of dreams, and found my calling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s funny, looking back on its subtle themes of media accessibility. Though I hadn’t grasped the concept yet, I knew people needed resources to educate themselves. Since then, I’ve witnessed intellect act as a vital function for survival. Everyone needs truth to gain power over their own lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At eleven-years-old, my plan evolved. Reality interested me far more than fiction ever could, so I decided to be a journalist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In early high school, this solidified at The Newseum when I saw, “There are three people who run towards danger and not away: Police, firemen, and reporters.” I read the dreams I wanted as a child, and a calling that encompassed them all.
