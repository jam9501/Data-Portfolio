        <p>Hi, I’m Ainsley Martinez!</p>
        <p>Thank you for the opportunity to share some of my work.</p>
        <p>Throughout high school and college, I planted myself in various newsrooms—from monthly magazines, to daily newspapers, to investigative digital platforms.</p>
        <p>Although the news organizations I worked at differ in structure and content, one common thread held them all together: the focus on local communities.</p>
        <p>I thrive and find fulfillment in working at local news outlets. The teams are more collaborative, and in some ways, more creative. There’s a unique joy in overcoming challenges and curating innovations without a plethora of resources.</p>
        <p>I believe I can find that joy with Richner Communications, and provide more efficient ways of developing hard-hitting stories with engaging graphics.</p>
        
        <h2>Below are some examples of graphics and datasets I’ve created through a mix of coding and Adobe Illustrator:</h2>
        
        <div class="projects">
            <p>I created this map using QGIS and Adobe Illustrator. The interactive web version has a tooltip implemented, where the user can hover over a neighborhood and the label/name appears.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jam9501/Data-Portfolio/main/nyc_map.png" alt="New York Map">
            </div>

            <p>A prototype game interactive that mimics the experience of people with motor disabilities using a mouse, with a research analysis. I used Python for the data analysis and D3 + JavaScript for the game:

            <p>I scraped and extracted the data from the New York State Senate website (https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation) for all bills passed in 2023, using Selenium. Then, I used an OpenAI library with Python to code a function for categorizing bills by topic. The spreadsheet and coding notebook are available:

            <p>I created an interactive graphic from scratch using Adobe Illustrator and D3 + JavaScript, which allows the notebook graphic to open, and animates the text. With JavaScript, I created a scrolly-telling template, which allows the reader to scroll through the story. I used Python for the analysis. I interviewed the only software developer at Amazon experiencing blindness on his experience with inaccessible tools:

            <p>I built an automated scraper for a project on comparing French news coverage from the United States. This automatically extracts headlines from the website every five minutes, and uploads them into a spreadsheet for me: 
            <a href="https://github.com/jam9501/el-pais-autoscraper" target="_blank">https://github.com/jam9501/el-pais-autoscraper</a></p>

            <p>This project is for Columbia Journalism School's LEDE program. I wanted to explore what different tie knots presidential candidates wore, and if there was a correlation between successful candidates and their choice of knot. Because data on presidential candidates and tie knot choices did not exist in a traditional format, I created my own dataset based on archival footage and photos of presidential debates, etc. I used AI to categorize knots based on the photos. Theodore Roosevelt was the first presidential candidate to wear a traditional tie, so the data looks at candidates after 1908. I only included candidates post-primaries. I coded the bar graph in Python, then stylized it afterwards in Adobe Illustrator, and created the tie graphics using Adobe Illustrator. I animated the photos using D3 + JavaScript: 
            <a href="https://jam9501.github.io/presidential-ties/ties.html" target="_blank">https://jam9501.github.io/presidential-ties/ties.html</a></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Of course, the content and design will change based on the newsrooms’ needs and preferences, but I believe fostering these skills will lead to more engagement and reporting efficiency.</p>
        
        <p>In Jeffrey L. Griffin & Robert L. Stevenson’s research, “The influence of statistical graphics on newspaper reader recall,” two different experiments suggested graphics helped readers digest material more easily.</p>

        <p>“The ability to answer and accuracy were highest for the group with the story plus infographic plus photo,” reported the journal, adding the group with the lowest ability was given the text without graphics or photos.</p>

        <p>Visualizations helped readers and viewers more ways to take in and learn content— improving accessibility, thus engagement.</p>

        <p>AI and programming tools, like scraping websites and building automated datasets, help reporters complete stories faster and cover more investigative content.</p>

        <p>I would be honored to join the team, and develop these skills in the newsroom.</p>
